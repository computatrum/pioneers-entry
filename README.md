This is our entry to the pioneers compitition.
We made a nerf gun shooting robot.
The first script here is one that allows us to control it with bluetooth
The other script is for when you are busy and need protection
It waits until it can sense any motion.
If it can it fires.
The distance sensor has a tube around it that covers all the sides so it can only sense movement if it is straight in front of it.
Hope you like it,
